This program has changed from BIC to Artificial Intelligence and Entrepreneurship. My friend got admitted but my first priority is Computational Biology and they probably stop reviewing your materials after you've been offered another program at the same school.

Got an interview for my speaking, probably due to my low TOEFL scores. It went well and I got a small scholarship of 3,000 dollar. Good for someone who really want to continue research/career in computational biology field.

**Extra**

Please describe your previous academic work in your proposed field of study and include a personal statement regarding your goals for graduate study and a professional career. Please also describe any relevant research experience and what you have learned from it, and other educational and life experiences that you feel are important and relevant. If you have specific interests in your proposed field of study or are interested in working with any particular faculty members, please tell us about them.

Word maximums may vary by program. Please review program application instructions for more information.

I am applying to the M.S. or Ph.D. program. Am I required to provide three faculty names in the CS Interest Form?

This is not required. But, we strongly encourage you to identify at least three CS faculty with whom you might want to work if admitted. Please explore the CS faculty profiles on our website if you are not familiar with the research interests of our faculty. CS faculty are also listed by research area.

Got rejected. Will ask them why. But my guess is the lack of cs courses. This program is quite CS concentrated.
